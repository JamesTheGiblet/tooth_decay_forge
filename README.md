# ToothForge Pro 🦷

**Predictive Dental Health Simulator Using Decay Kinetics**

A real-time tooth decay and whitening fade calculator based on 
published dental research and exponential decay models.

## 🔬 Scientific Foundation

Uses established decay kinetics:
- Stephan Curve (pH recovery after meals)
- Remineralization rates (fluoride impact)
- Bacterial doubling times (S. mutans)
- Whitening fade kinetics (peroxide breakdown)

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time decay simulation** with pH event tracking
- **Whitening ROI calculator** with treatment comparison
- **Genetic modifiers** (enamel strength variants)
- **Cost projection** over 5/10/20 year timelines
- **Mobile-first PWA** with offline capability
- **Export reports** as PDF with dental shade charts

## 📊 Use Cases

### For Individuals
- Track daily pH exposure
- Optimize brushing schedule
- Plan whitening maintenance
- Visualize long-term cavity risk

### For Dental Practices
- Patient education tool
- Treatment acceptance aid
- Prevention compliance tracking
- Professional white-label version available

## 🎯 Accuracy

Based on peer-reviewed research:
- Featherstone (2008) - The Caries Balance
- Zero & Lussi (2005) - Erosion kinetics
- Joiner (2006) - Tooth whitening decay rates
