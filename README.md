# ToothForge Pro 🦷

**Predictive Dental Health Simulator & Patient Education Tool**

A real-time tooth decay, gum health, and whitening fade calculator designed for dental professionals to demonstrate the long-term impact of patient habits.

## 🔬 Scientific Foundation

Uses established decay kinetics:

- **Stephan Curve**: pH recovery modeling after meals.
- **Biofilm Activity**: Bacterial growth modeling (S. mutans doubling times).
- **Whitening Kinetics**: Peroxide breakdown and sensitivity risk assessment.
- **Caries Risk Assessment**: Based on CAMBRA protocols.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎮 Dual Interface

- **Adult Mode**: Detailed clinical data, financial projections, and specific lifestyle inputs (coffee, smoking, etc.).
- **Kids Mode**: Gamified interface with "Super Smile Score", simplified language ("Sugar Bugs"), and fun animations.

### 🦷 Interactive Visualization

- **Dynamic Dental Map**: Visual representation of 32 teeth showing real-time staining and cavity formation based on inputs.
- **Biofilm Graph**: Interactive chart showing bacterial regrowth post-brushing.

### 📉 Comprehensive Simulation

- **Lifestyle Inputs**: Brushing frequency, sugar intake, flossing, fluoride use, and more.
- **Financial Projection**: Estimates 10-year treatment costs vs. prevention savings.
- **Health Metrics**: Tracks Enamel Density, Gum Health, Whiteness (Shade), and Sensitivity.

## 📊 Use Cases

- **Patient Education**: Visually demonstrate the consequences of neglect vs. care.
- **Treatment Acceptance**: Show the financial benefit of preventative care.
- **Pediatric Dentistry**: Engage children with the interactive "Brush Now" confetti feature.
